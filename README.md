What is the mission statement of *Pu ReVu*? To help you find a **Glorious** and **Clean** public restroom experience without hassle!

It happens all too often. You're out on the town and nature calls. Home is too far, and you must make do with what's around. But you can never be sure what you might get when it comes to public facilities. That's where *Pu ReVu* comes in. Simply start the web app and hit **"Let's Go!"**

First thing, the *Pu ReVu* site will take account of your current location and load up a list of public restrooms in your area. Each one listed with an overall user recommendation and cleanliness rating. Click on a specific public restroom to get a full breakdown of all ratings along with any comments left by *ReVuers*™. This way you'll know what to avoid, and where to *go*.

But say you've found a discrepancy in a *ReVu*, or a restroom that lacks a rating. Now it's your chance to write your own *Pu ReVu* and become part of the *ReVuers*™ community. Simply list the business or location name, along with your zip code if not already documented by the site. Give a recommendation and cleanliness rating along with a personal comment. Hit the **Submit** button and you've done it! Now your *ReVu* is live and helping others.

Finally, you're ready to have a relaxing restroom experience. To help, *Pu ReVu* has provided a few reading materials to help pass the time. You can search the top trending *New York Times* articles by topic, try out the Dad Joke Generator, or check the local forecast.

It's easy, it's convenient, it's Pu Revu.
